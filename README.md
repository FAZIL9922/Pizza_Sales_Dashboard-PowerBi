# Pizza_Sales_Dashboard-PowerBi

NOTE:

1.  I have attached the Power BI file named Pizza Sales.pbix along with the SQL queries that were executed in MSSQL for cross-checking the data present in the Power BI dashboard.

2.  Additionally, I have included the images used to create the dashboard, the CSV file, and the Excel file used to fetch the SQL queries and assist in the dashboard creation.

3.  In Power BI, I utilized the Power Query Editor for data cleaning and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for data processing. I employed various charts and graphs to create a dynamic visualization. By using slicers, we can obtain sales insights data for specific periods.
